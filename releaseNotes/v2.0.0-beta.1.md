# SuperSocket.MessagePack v2.0.0-beta.1 Release Notes

We're excited to announce the first beta release of SuperSocket.MessagePack, a powerful integration library that combines the high-performance SuperSocket networking framework with MessagePack's efficient binary serialization capabilities.

## Overview

SuperSocket.MessagePack is designed to simplify network communication by providing a robust, type-based messaging system with cross-platform and cross-language compatibility. This initial release establishes the foundation for efficient binary serialization and deserialization for network messages in SuperSocket applications.

## Key Features

- **MessagePack Integration**: Leverages the speed and efficiency of MessagePack binary serialization with SuperSocket
- **Type-Based Messaging**: Centralizes message type registration with a unified type registry
- **Binary Protocol Support**: Implements a standardized fixed-header message format with length and type ID
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Supports multiple .NET target frameworks, including:
  - .NET 6.0, .NET 7.0, .NET 8.0, .NET 9.0
  - Optional mobile target frameworks support (iOS, Android, macOS, tvOS)

## Core Components

### MessagePackTypeRegistry

A centralized registry for MessagePack message types and their type identifiers, allowing message type sharing between encoders, decoders, clients, and servers:

- **Type Registration**: Pair message types with their corresponding numeric identifiers
- **Type Safety**: Ensures consistent type mapping across the communication pipeline
- **Customizable Options**: Supports custom MessagePack serialization options

### MessagePackPipelineFilter

Pipeline filter for handling MessagePack messages with a standardized 8-byte header:
- First 4 bytes: Message size (big-endian)
- Next 4 bytes: Message type ID (big-endian)

### MessagePackPackageEncoder

Provides encoding functionality for transforming application objects into network-ready binary packets with the proper header information.

### MessagePackPackageDecoder

Provides decoding functionality for converting binary data back into strongly-typed objects based on the type identifier in the message header.

## Getting Started

SuperSocket.MessagePack is built on SuperSocket 2.0 and MessagePack for C# 3.1.3, offering a seamless integration between these powerful libraries. View the README for comprehensive examples of how to set up both client and server applications with SuperSocket.MessagePack.

## Compatibility Notes

This beta release is compatible with:
- SuperSocket.ProtoBase 2.0.0
- MessagePack 3.1.3
- Requires .NET 6.0 or higher

## What's Next

As we move toward a stable release, we plan to:
- Add additional message routing capabilities
- Improve integration with SuperSocket.Server
- Enhance documentation and code examples
- Expand test coverage
